Welcome! With just a few steps you too, can be on your way to sending memes to your friends and/or enemies!

Steps
1. make a copy of 'config-template.py' named 'config.py' and fill in your username and password in 'config.py'

2. create a folder called 'memes' with another folder called 'old-memes' inside (there by default)

3. place any number of photos in .jpg, .png, or .gif format inside 'memes' folder

4. edit .bat file with path of your python installation and path to where you saved this project folder

5. run the .bat file


NOTES:
-Do NOT commit info within config.py, it has been gitignored on purpose
-Due to some changes with Facebook's API, you may receive a suspicious activity alert that will prompt you to change your password. This is an ongoing issue that will be resolved in a future update to meme-bot.
